# coronavirus_flexdashboard
This repository contains the files and code used to create a basic Coronavirus dashboard.

The hosted app can be found at:

This dashboard is not meant to be an official source of information, but rather a simple attempt to display interesting data about the Coronavirus pandemic and to practice data visualization in R.

I welcome any comments or suggestions.
